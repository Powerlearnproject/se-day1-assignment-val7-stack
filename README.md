Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:

"Write something about cats."
Why this is vague:

It's extremely broad. What kind of "something"? A story? Facts? A poem?
It lacks any specific instructions or context.
The AI has to make many assumptions, which may not align with your intent.
Improved Prompt:

"Write a short, humorous story about a cat who tries to steal a slice of pizza from a sleeping person. The story should be no more than 150 words."
Why this is a better prompt:

Clear and Specific:
It specifies the type of content (a story).
It provides a clear scenario (cat stealing pizza).
It sets a tone (humorous).
it specifies the maximum length of the response.
Concise:
It conveys all necessary information in a brief and direct manner.
Contextual:
It gives the AI a clear context to work within.
Effectiveness:

The improved prompt is far more likely to produce a response that meets your expectations.
It reduces the chance of receiving irrelevant or generic content.
It guides the AI to generate a more focused and creative output.
It lowers the amount of times that you would have to run the prompt again, trying to get the correct output.
